        I've been building stuff my whole life. Long before I was writing code professionally, I was a software
        engineer&mdash;as a hobbyist and in my first career running movie theaters&mdash;using programming skills to
        maximize the time and effectiveness of myself and my team. I believe in automating the mundane, delivering high
        value quickly, and building things that are extensible and easily maintained. And I enjoy refactors&mdash;making
        existing software faster, cheaper, and more elegant.

        I joined the startup

        in 2013 as a junior engineer and helped build our best-in-class virtual event and hiring SaaS platform from
        scratch. By the time of our 2023 sale into the

        </jsp:include>, I'd been Brazen's Vice President of Engineering for 2 years. The outcome of multiple rounds of
        technical diligence, completed by Brazen's Chief Technology Officer and myself, was cited as a key factor in our
        acquisition. I stayed on into mid-2024 to help ensure a successful transition into our new parent company,
        leading all of Brazen's IT personnel after the exit of our CTO in January of that year.

        After a little break, I'm hungry to build something new. <i>What</i> that next thing will be is less important
        to me than <i>how</i> and <i>why</i>. So you bring the <i>what</i>, and let's team up to build your next great
        idea!
