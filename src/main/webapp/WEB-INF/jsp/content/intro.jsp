        I've been building stuff for as long as I can remember. As a kid, it was Legos; since a programmable graphing
        calculator was put in my middle-school hands, it's been software. Even before I was writing code professionally,
        I was a software engineer&mdash;as a hobbyist and as a movie theater general manager&mdash;using those skills to
        maximize the time and effectiveness of myself and my people. Also, building stuff is just really fun! I believe
        in automating the mundane, delivering high value quickly, and building things that are extensible and easily
        maintained. And I enjoy refactors&mdash;making existing software faster, cheaper, and more elegant.

        </jsp:include>, I'd been Brazen's Vice President of Engineering for 2 years. The outcome of multiple rounds of
        technical diligence, completed by Brazen's Chief Technology Officer and myself, was cited as a key factor in our
        acquisition. I stayed on into mid-2024 to help ensure a successful transition into our new parent company,
        leading all of Brazen's IT personnel after the exit of our CTO in January of that year.

        After a little break, I'm hungry to build something new. <i>What</i> that next thing will be is less important
        to me than <i>how</i> and <i>why</i>. So let's team up to build your next great idea!
