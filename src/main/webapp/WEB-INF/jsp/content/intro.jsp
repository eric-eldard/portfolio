        I've been building stuff my whole life, and I was writing software long before I was doing it professionally. As
        a hobbyist and in my first career running movie theaters, I used programming skills to maximize the time and
        effectiveness of myself and my team. I believe in automating the mundane, delivering high value
        quickly&mdash;then iterating, and building things that are extensible and easily maintained. And I enjoy
        improving existing software, making it faster, cheaper, and more elegant.

        I joined the startup

        in 2013 as a junior engineer and helped build our best-in-class virtual event and hiring SaaS platform from
        scratch. By the time of our 2023 sale into the

        </jsp:include>, I'd been Brazen's Vice President of Engineering for 2 years. Technical diligence I completed
        alongside Brazen's Chief Technology Officer was cited as a key factor in our acquisition. I stayed on into
        mid-2024 to help ensure a successful transition into our new parent company, leading all of Brazen's IT
        personnel after the exit of our CTO in January of that year.

        After a little break, I'm hungry to build something new. Figuring out <i>how</i> things are built is what gets
        me up in the morning, so you bring the <i>what</i>, and let's team up to build your next great idea!
